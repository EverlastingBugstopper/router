description: Running the router in development mode
---

During development, it is useful to run the Apollo Router with increased logging and relaxed security constraints.

Development mode modifies the default configuration of the router to:
* Serve Apollo Sandbox Explorer rather than the Apollo Router page - Allows you to easily run queries against your development Router.
* Enable supergraph introspection - Allows Apollo Sandbox Explorer to provide content completion and information about the supergraph schema.
* Enable query plan introspection - Allows Apollo Sandbox Explorer to display on how your query was executed.
* Propagate errors from subgraphs - Allows GraphQL errors from subgraphs to be propagated back to the client.   
* Enable hot reloading of configuration - Equivalent to running the router with `--hot-reload`, changes in your router configuration are reflected without a restart.

To run the Apollo Router in development mode:
```bash
router --dev
```

<blockquote>
**⚠️ Do not use the `--dev` flag in production!**
<br/>
The features enabled in development mode may change over time. If you want to replicate any development mode functionality in production, modify your YAML configuration file instead.
</blockquote>

The equivalent yaml `router.yaml` file is:
```yaml file="router.yaml"
sandbox:
  enabled: true
supergraph:
  introspection: true
include_subgraph_errors:
  all: true
plugins:
  experimental.expose_query_plan: true
```
