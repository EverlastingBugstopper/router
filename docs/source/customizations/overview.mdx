title: Customizations for the Apollo Router
description: Extend the Apollo Router with custom functionality
---

You can write customizations for the Apollo Router to add functionality that isn't offered by default. For example, you can make an external call to fetch authentication data for each incoming request.

## Customization types

The Apollo Router supports two classes of customization. 

* [Schema Driven Behaviour](./sdb/)
* [Pipeline Driven Behaviour](./pdb/)

Schema Driven Customization is a mechanism which allows schema directives to be applied to operations.

Pipeline Driven Customization is a mechanism which allows arbitrary (non-schema) interactions be applied to operations.
