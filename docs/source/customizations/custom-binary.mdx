title: Creating a custom router binary
---

To create your own router binary with custom plugins you will need to use the router as a library.
This page will walk you through creating your own Router binary from scratch and creating a plugin.

# Prerequisites

To compile the Apollo Router you will need to have the following installed.

* [rust 1.61.0](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* nodejs 16.9.1

Once you have the basics installed, install `cargo-xtask` and `cargo-scaffold`
```bash
cargo install cargo-xtask
cargo install cargo-scaffold
```

# Create new project

1. Use cargo scaffold to create the project. It will ask some questions about project.
   
   ```bash
   cargo-scaffold scaffold https://github.com/apollographql/router.git -r apollo-router-scaffold/templates/base
   ```
   You will be asked some questions about your project. For the purposes of this tutorial use `starstuff`.
   
2. After the project has been created change to the `starstuff` directory
   ```bash
   cd starstuff
   ```

# Compile the router

To create a debug build use the following command.
```bash
cargo build
```
Your debug binary is now located in `target/debug/router`


For production, you will want to create a release build.
```bash
cargo build --release
```
Your release binary is now located in `target/release/router`

# Run the Apollo Router

1. Download the example schema

   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://supergraph.demo.starstuff.dev/ > supergraph-schema.graphql
   ```

2. Run the Apollo Router
   
   During development it is convenient to use `cargo run` to run the Apollo Router as it will 
   ```bash 
   cargo run -- --hot-reload --config router.yaml --supergraph supergraph-schema.graphql
   ```
   
> If you are using managed federation you can set APOLLO_KEY and APOLLO_GRAPH_REF environment variables instead of specifying the supergraph as a file.

# Create a plugin

1. From within your project directory scaffold a new plugin
   ```bash
   cargo router plugin create hello_world
   ```
2. Select the type of plugin you want to scaffold:
   ```bash
   Select a plugin template:
   > "basic"
   "auth"
   "tracing"
   ```
   
   The different templates are:
   * basic - a barebones plugin.
   * auth - a basic authentication plugin that could make an external call.
   * tracing - a plugin that adds a custom span and a log message.
   
   Choose `basic`.

4. Add the plugin to the `router.yaml`
   ```yaml
   plugins:
     starstuff.hello_world:
       message: "Starting my plugin"
   ```

5. Run the Apollo Router and see your plugin start up
   ```bash
   cargo run -- --hot-reload --config router.yaml --supergraph supergraph-schema.graphql
   ```
    
   In your output you should see something like:
   ```bash
   2022-05-21T09:16:33.160288Z  INFO router::plugins::hello_world: Starting my plugin
   ```

# Remove a plugin

1. From within your project run the following command. It makes a best effort to remove the plugin, but your mileage may vary. 
   ```bash
   cargo router plugin remove hello_world
   ```
