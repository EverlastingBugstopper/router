## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

### Reference-counting for the schema string given to plugins ([PR #???](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/))

The type of the `supergraph_sdl` field of the `apollo_router::plugin::PluginInit` struct
was changed from `String` to `Arc<String>`.
This reduces the number of copies of this string we keep in memory, as schemas can get large.

### Changes to `PluginTestHarness` ([PR #1468](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1468))

The `plugin` method of the builder for `apollo_router::plugin::test::PluginTestHarness` was removed.
Users of `PluginTestHarness` don‚Äôt create plugin instances themselves anymore.

Instead, the builder has a new mandatory `configuration` method,
which takes the full Router configuration as would be found in a `router.yaml` file.
Through that configuration, plugins can be enabled (and configured) by name.
Instead of YAML syntax though, the method takes a `serde_json::Value`.
A convenient way to create such a value in Rust code is with the `json!` macro.

The `IntoSchema` enum has been removed.
The `schema` method of the builder is now optional and takes a `&str`.
If not provided, the canned testing schema is used by default.

Additionally, `PluginTestHarness` internally creates a Tower `Service`
that is closer to a ‚Äúfull‚Äù Router than before:
Apollo plugins that are enabled by default (such as CSRF protection)
will be enabled in the test harness,
and all enabled plugins will have their `Plugin::activate` method called
during harness creation.

Changes to tests for an example plugin:

```diff
-use apollo_router::plugin::test::IntoSchema::Canned;
 use apollo_router::plugin::test::PluginTestHarness;
-use apollo_router::plugin::Plugin;
-use apollo_router::plugin::PluginInit;
+use serde_json::json;
 
-let conf = MyPluginConfig {
-    something: "something".to_string(),
-};
-let plugin = MyPlugin::new(PluginInit::new(conf, Default::default()))
-    .await
-    .unwrap();
+let conf = json!({
+    "plugins": {
+        "example.my_plugin": {
+            "something": "something"
+        }
+    }
+});
 let test_harness = PluginTestHarness::builder()
-            .plugin(plugin)
-            .schema(Canned)
+            .configuration(conf)
             .build()
             .await
             .unwarp();
```

### Changes to `RouterRequest::fake_builder` defaults to `Content-Type: application/json` ([PR #1468](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1468))

Because of the change above, tests that use `PluginTestHarness` will now go through
CSRF-protection, which might reject some requests.
`apollo_router::services::RouterRequest` has a builder for creating a ‚Äúfake‚Äù request during tests.
When no `Content-Type` header is specified, this builder will now default to `application/json`
which makes the request be accepted by CSRF protection.
If a test requires a request specifically *without* a `Content-Type` header,
this default can be removed from a `RouterRequest` after building it:

```rust
let mut router_request = RouterRequesT::fake_builder().build();
router_request.originating_request.headers_mut().remove("content-type");
```

## üöÄ Features

### `mock_execution_service` for `PluginTestHarness` ([PR #1468](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1468))

The builder for `apollo_router::plugin::test::PluginTestHarness` 
has a new `mock_execution_service` method.
This allows adding a mock at the execution stage of the pipeline,
similar to the other `mock_*` methods taht were already present.

## üêõ Fixes

### Configuration handling enhancements ([PR #1454](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1454))

Router config handling now:
* Allows completely empty configuration without error.
* Prevents unknown tags at the root of the configuration from being silently ignored.

Update existing filesystem based example to illustrate how to do the same thing using our OCI stored helm chart.
